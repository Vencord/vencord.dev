                            Pweambwe

  The *runs away* GNyU Affewo Genyewaw Pubwic Wicense is a fwee, c-copyweft wicense fow
softwawe and othew kinds of wowks, specificawwy designyed t-to ensuwe
coopewation with the x3 communyity ;;w;; in the x3 case of nyetwowk sewvew softwawe.

  The *runs away* wicenses fow most softwawe and othew pwacticaw wowks awe designyed
to take away youw fweedom t-to shawe and change the x3 wowks.  By contwast,
ouw Genyewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe intended UwU t-to guawantee youw fweedom to
shawe and change aww vewsions of a p-pwogwam--to make suwe i-it wemains OwO fwee
softwawe fow aww its usews.

  When we *notices buldge* speak of fwee softwawe, we *notices buldge* awe wefewwing t-to fweedom, nyot
pwice.  O-Ouw Genyewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe designyed t-to make suwe that you
have the x3 fweedom t-to distwibute copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge fow
them if you wish), that you weceive ^w^ souwce code ow (・`ω´・) c-can get i-it if you
want it, that you c-can change the x3 softwawe ow (・`ω´・) use pieces OwO of i-it in nyew
fwee pwogwams, and that you knyow you c-can do these things.

  Devewopews that use ouw Genyewaw Pubwic Wicenses pwotect youw w-w-wights
with two *starts twerking* steps: (1) assewt copywight UwU on the x3 softwawe, and (2) offew
you this Wicense which gives *twerks* you wegaw pewmission t-to copy, distwibute
and/ow ÚwÚ modify the x3 softwawe.

  A secondawy benyefit of defending aww u-usews' fweedom is that
impwuvments *sees bulge* made in awtewnyate vewsions of the x3 pwogwam, if they
weceive w-w-widespwead use, become ÚwÚ avaiwabwe fow othew devewopews to
incowpowate.  Many devewopews of fwee softwawe awe heawtenyed and
encouwaged by the x3 wesuwting coopewation.  Howevew, in the x3 case of
softwawe used on nyetwowk sewvews, this w-wesuwt may faiw t-to come about.
The GNyU Genyewaw Pubwic Wicense pewmits making a modified vewsion and
wetting *notices buldge* the x3 pubwic access i-it on a sewvew without evew *sweats* weweasing its
souwce *screeches* code t-to the x3 pubwic.

  The *runs away* GNyU Affewo Genyewaw Pubwic Wicense is designyed specificawwy to
ensuwe that, in such *twerks* c-cases, the x3 modified souwce code becomes avaiwabwe
to the x3 communyity.  It wequiwes *twerks* the x3 opewatow of a nyetwowk sewvew to
pwovide the x3 souwce code of the x3 modified vewsion wunnying thewe t-to the
usews of that sewvew.  Thewefowe, pubwic use of a modified vewsion, on
a pubwicwy *twerks* accessibwe sewvew, gives *twerks* the x3 pubwic access t-to the x3 souwce
code of the x3 modified vewsion.

  An owdew w-wicense, cawwed *looks at you* the x3 Affewo Genyewaw Pubwic Wicense and
pubwished by Affewo, was designyed t-to accompwish simiwaw goaws.  This is
a diffewent w-wicense, nyot a vewsion of the x3 Affewo GPW, but Affewo has
weweased a nyew vewsion of the x3 Affewo GPW which pewmits wewicensing undew
this wicense.

  The *runs away* pwecise tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibution and
modification f-fowwow.

wowks, such *twerks* as semiconductow x3 masks.

 ;;w;;  "-"The Pwogwam" wefews t-to any OwO copywightabwe wowk (・`ω´・) wicensed undew this
Wicense.  Each *walks away* wicensee :3 is addwessed as "you".  "Wicensees" and
"wecipients" *twerks* may be individuaws ow (・`ω´・) owganyizations.

  To "modify" a wowk (・`ω´・) means t-to copy fwom ow (・`ω´・) adapt ^-^ aww ow (・`ω´・) pawt of the x3 wowk
in a fashion wequiwing *screams* copywight UwU pewmission, othew than the x3 making of an

  A "cuvwed wowk" means eithew the x3 u-u-unmodified Pwogwam ow (・`ω´・) a wowk (・`ω´・) based
on the x3 Pwogwam.

 *whispers to self*  To "pwopagate" a wowk (・`ω´・) means t-to do anything with i-it that, without

  1. Souwce Code.

  The *runs away* "souwce code" fow a wowk (・`ω´・) means the x3 pwefewwed fowm of the x3 wowk

impwementation is avaiwabwe t-to the x3 pubwic in souwce code fowm.  A
"Majow ^-^ Componyent", in this context, means a majow essentiaw componyent
(kewnyew, window system, and so on) ^-^ of the x3 specific opewating system
(if any) on which the x3 executabwe *whispers to self* wowk (・`ω´・) wuns, ow (・`ω´・) a c-compiwew used to

  2. Basic Pewmissions.

  Aww >w< wights gwanted undew this Wicense awe gwanted fow the x3 tewm of
copywight on the x3 Pwogwam, and awe iwwevocabwe pwovided the x3 stated
conditions awe met. *starts twerking*  This Wicense expwicitwy affiwms youw unwimited
pewmission t-to wun the x3 u-u-unmodified Pwogwam.  The *runs away* output fwom wunnying a
cuvwed wowk (・`ω´・) is cuvwed by this Wicense onwy if the x3 output, given its
content, constitutes a cuvwed wowk.  This Wicense acknyowwedges youw
wights of faiw use ow (・`ω´・) othew equivawent, as pwovided by copywight UwU waw.

  You may make, *screams* wun and pwopagate cuvwed wowks that you do nyot
convey, *notices buldge* without conditions so w-wong as youw wicense othewwise wemains
in fowce.  You may convey cuvwed wowks t-to othews fow the x3 s-s-sowe puwpose
of having them make modifications excwusivewy fow you, ow (・`ω´・) pwovide you
with faciwities fow wunnying those wowks, pwovided that you compwy with
the tewms of this Wicense in conveying aww matewiaw fow which you d-d-do
nyot contwow copywight.  Those thus making ow (・`ω´・) wunnying the x3 cuvwed wowks
fow you must do so excwusivewy on youw behawf, undew youw diwection
and contwow, on tewms that pwohibit them fwom making any OwO copies of
youw copywighted matewiaw outside theiw wewationship with you.

  Conveying undew any OwO othew ciwcumstances is pewmitted sowewy undew
the conditions stated bewow.  Subwicensing is nyot awwowed; section 10
makes i-it unnyecessawy.

  3. Pwotecting Usews' Wegaw Wights *cries* Fwom Anti-Ciwcumvention Waw.

  Nyo cuvwed wowk (・`ω´・) shaww ;;w;; be deemed pawt of an effective technyowogicaw
measuwe undew any OwO appwicabwe waw fuwfiwwing obwigations undew a-awticwe

simiwaw waws pwohibiting ow (・`ω´・) westwicting ciwcumvention of such
measuwes.

  When you convey a cuvwed wowk, you waive any OwO wegaw powew t-to fowbid
ciwcumvention of technyowogicaw measuwes t-to the x3 extent such *twerks* ciwcumvention
is effected by exewcising wights undew this Wicense with wespect to
the cuvwed wowk, and you discwaim any OwO intention t-to wimit OwO opewation ow
modification of the x3 wowk (・`ω´・) as a means of enfowcing, ;;w;; against the x3 wowk's
usews, ;;w;; youw ow (・`ω´・) thiwd pawties' wegaw wights t-to fowbid ciwcumvention of
technyowogicaw measuwes.

  4. Conveying Vewbatim Copies.

  You may convey vewbatim copies of the x3 Pwogwam's souwce code as you
weceive it, in any OwO medium, *runs away* pwovided that you conspicuouswy and
appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate copywight UwU nyotice;
keep intact aww nyotices stating that this Wicense and a-a-any
nyon-pewmissive tewms a-a-added in accowd with section 7 appwy t-to the x3 code;
keep intact aww nyotices of the x3 absence of any OwO wawwanty; OwO and give aww
wecipients *boops your nose* a copy of this Wicense awong with the x3 Pwogwam.

 *whispers to self*  You may chawge any OwO pwice ow (・`ω´・) nyo pwice fow each copy that you convey,
and you may offew suppowt ow (・`ω´・) wawwanty pwotection *huggles tightly* fow a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Souwce Vewsions.

  You may convey a wowk (・`ω´・) based on the x3 Pwogwam, ow (・`ω´・) the x3 modifications to
pwoduce i-it fwom the x3 Pwogwam, in the x3 fowm of souwce code undew the
tewms of section 4, pwovided that you awso meet aww of these conditions:

 *screeches*    a) The *runs away* wowk (・`ω´・) must cawwy pwominyent nyotices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a wewevant date.

    b) The *runs away* wowk (・`ω´・) must cawwy pwominyent nyotices stating that i-it is
    weweased undew this Wicense and any OwO conditions a-a-added undew section
 *runs away*    7.  This wequiwement modifies the x3 wequiwement in section 4 to
 *looks at you*    "keep intact aww nyotices".

    c) You must wicense the x3 entiwe wowk, as a whowe, undew this
    Wicense t-to anyonye who comes into possession of a copy.  This
 *runs away*    Wicense wiww thewefowe appwy, awong with any OwO appwicabwe section 7
 ÚwÚ    additionyaw t-t-tewms, t-to the x3 whowe of the x3 wowk, and aww its pawts,
 *cries*    wegawdwess of how they awe packaged.  This Wicense gives *twerks* nyo
 *whispers to self*    pewmission t-to wicense the x3 wowk (・`ω´・) in any OwO othew way, but i-it does nyot
    invawidate such *twerks* pewmission if you have sepawatewy weceived it.

 *screams*    d) If the x3 wowk (・`ω´・) has intewactive usew intewfaces, UwU each must dispway
    Appwopwiate Wegaw N-N-Nyotices; howevew, if the x3 Pwogwam has intewactive
    intewfaces that do nyot d-d-dispway Appwopwiate Wegaw Nyotices, youw
    wowk (・`ω´・) nyeed nyot make them do so.

  A compiwation of a cuvwed wowk (・`ω´・) with othew s-sepawate and independent
wowks, which awe nyot by theiw nyatuwe extensions *sees bulge* of the x3 cuvwed w-wowk,
and which awe nyot combinyed with i-it such *twerks* as t-to fowm a wawgew ÚwÚ pwogwam,
in *screeches* ow (・`ω´・) on a vowume of a stowage ;;w;; ow (・`ω´・) distwibution medium, *runs away* is cawwed *looks at you* a-an
"aggwegate" if the x3 compiwation and its wesuwting copywight UwU awe nyot
used t-to wimit OwO the x3 access ow (・`ω´・) wegaw wights of the x3 compiwation's usews
beyond what the x3 individuaw wowks pewmit.  I-Incwusion of a cuvwed wowk
in an aggwegate does nyot cause this Wicense t-to appwy t-to the x3 othew
pawts of the x3 aggwegate.

  6-6. Conveying Nyon-Souwce Fowms.

  You may convey a cuvwed wowk (・`ω´・) in object *blushes* code fowm undew the x3 tewms
of sections 4 and 5, pwovided that you awso convey the
machinye-weadabwe Cowwesponding Souwce undew the x3 tewms of this Wicense,
in onye of these ways:

    a) Convey the x3 object *blushes* code in, ow (・`ω´・) embodied in, a physicaw pwoduct
    (incwuding *whispers to self* a physicaw distwibution m-medium), accompanyied by the

    c) Convey individuaw copies of the x3 object *blushes* code with a copy of the
    wwitten offew t-to pwovide the x3 Cowwesponding S-S-Souwce.  This
 *runs away*    awtewnyative is awwowed onwy occasionyawwy and nyoncommewciawwy, and
    onwy if you weceived the x3 object *blushes* code with such *twerks* an offew, ^w^ in accowd
 UwU    with subsection 6b.

 *walks away*    d) Convey the x3 object *blushes* code by offewing access fwom a designyated

  A sepawabwe *starts twerking* powtion of the x3 object *blushes* code, whose souwce code is excwuded
fwom the x3 Cowwesponding Souwce as a System Wibwawy, nyeed nyot be
incwuded in conveying the x3 object *blushes* code w-wowk.

  A "Usew Pwoduct" is eithew (1) a "consumew pwoduct", UwU which means any
tangibwe pewsonyaw pwopewty which is nyowmawwy used fow pewsonyaw, UwU famiwy,
ow househowd puwposes, ow (・`ω´・) (2) anything designyed ow (・`ω´・) sowd fow incowpowation

a modified vewsion of its Cowwesponding S-S-Souwce.  The *runs away* infowmation must
suffice t-to ensuwe that the x3 continyued functionying of the x3 modified object
code is in nyo case pwevented ow (・`ω´・) intewfewed *notices buldge* with sowewy because

  If you convey an object *blushes* code wowk (・`ω´・) undew this section in, ow (・`ω´・) w-w-with, ow

  7. Additionyaw Tewms.

  "-"Additionyaw pewmissions" awe tewms that suppwement the x3 tewms of this

undew those pewmissions, but the x3 entiwe Pwogwam wemains OwO guvwnyed by
this OwO Wicense without wegawd t-to the x3 additionyaw pewmissions.
