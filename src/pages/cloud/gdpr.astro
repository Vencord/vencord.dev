    <h1>Vencord Cloud GDPR Policy</h1>
    <p class="p-subtitle">Last Updated: 06/04/2023</p>

    <p>
        This is the scary legal bit that we need to have (by law) to make sure
        that we are GDPR compliant. Long story short, we swear we won't do
        anything bad with your data, that we only use it for good and legitimate
        purposes, and that you can get it changed or removed at any time by
        contacting us at privacy@vencord.dev.
    </p>

    <p>We are a Data Controller of your information.</p>
    <p>
        Vencord's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
        described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we
        collect and the specific context in which we collect the information:
        <ul>
            <li>Vencord needs to perform a contract with you</li>
            <li>You have given Vencord permission to do so</li>
            <li>
                Processing your personal information is in Vencord's legitimate
                interests
            </li>
            <li>Vencord needs to comply with the law</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Vencord will retain your personal information only for as long as is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
        retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with
        our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have
        certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what Personal
        Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our
        systems, please contact us.
    </p>
    <p>
        In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The right to access, update or to delete the information we have
                on you
            </li>
            <li>The right of rectification</li>
            <li>The right to object</li>
            <li>The right of restriction</li>
            <li>The right to data portability</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw consent</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Log Files</h2>
    <p>
        Vencord follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log
        visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a
        part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log
        files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
        Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and
        possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information
        that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for
        analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on
        the website, and gathering demographic information.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Information</h2>
    <p>
        Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while
        using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe,
        participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vencord does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information
        from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided
        this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to
        contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly
        remove such information from our records.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
    <p>

        for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they
        shared and/or collect in Vencord. This policy is not applicable to any
        information collected offline or via channels other than this website.
