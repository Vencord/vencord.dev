import Card, { CardKind } from "components/Card.svelte";

<Card kind={CardKind.Warning}>
    These instructions are only for advanced users. If you're not a developer,
    you should use our graphical installer instead. No support will be provided
    for installing in this fashion. If you cannot figure it out, you should just
    stick to a regular install.
</Card>

## Dependencies

For a developer install, you will need the following tools before doing anything:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [pnpm](https://npm.im/pnpm)

## Installing Vencord

Clone Vencord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord
cd vencord
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Build Vencord:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Inject vencord into your client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

Then fully close Discord from your taskbar or task manager, and restart it. Vencord should be injected - you can check
this by looking for the Vencord section in Discord settings.

## Updating Vencord

If you're using Discord already, go into the `Updater` tab in settings.

Sometimes it may be necessary to manually update if the GUI updater fails. To pull latest changes:

```shell
git pull
```

If this fails, you likely need to reset your local changes to vencord to resolve merge errors:

<Card kind={CardKind.Warning}>
    This command will remove any local changes you've made to Vencord. Make sure
    you back up if you made any code changes you don't want to lose!
</Card>

```shell
git reset --hard
git pull
```

and then to build the changes:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Then just refresh your client

## Uninstalling Vencord

Simply run:

```shell
pnpm uninject
```

If you need more help, ask in the support channel in our [Discord Server](/discord).
