The only official website is `vencord.dev`, which can be confirmed on GitHub and the installer itself. We are not
affiliated with any other website, and therefore urge you to exercise caution when visiting sites not owned by us that
offer Vencord. They are fake sites that are highly likely to be malicious.

We are currently aware of the following sites impersonating us:

- `vencord.app`
- `vencord.xyz` - [ACTUAL MALWARRE DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT ALL COST](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f4c981438a224d6e37c984b07556a444c6f8677d76e566a1b54db33847f559c9?nocache=1)

If you have downloaded software offered by these sites, please remove it as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the
safety of anything distributed via them.
