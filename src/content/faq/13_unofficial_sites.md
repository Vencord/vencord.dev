title: What are the official websites for Vencord?
tags: vencord.app, unofficial, official
---

The only official website is `vencord.dev`, which can be confirmed on GitHub and the installer itself. We are not
affiliated with any other website, and therefore we urge you to exercise caution when visiting sites that offer Vencord
that aren't owned by us.

We are aware of another website, `vencord.app`, that currently looks like our site and offers our download links. We are
unsure why it exists, and have attempted to contact the site's owners to no avail. If you have downloaded software from
there, please delete it and download it from our official sources instead as we cannot confirm the safety of the
software you have downloaded.
