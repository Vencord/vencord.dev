title: What are the official websites for Vencord?
tags: unofficial, official
---

The only official website is `vencord.dev`, which can be confirmed on GitHub and the installer itself. We are not
affiliated with any other website, and any that claim to be or use our brand are malicious impersonators.

If you have downloaded software offered by these sites, remove it as soon as possible, run a malware scan,
reinstall Discord, and change your password. Also, if possible, dispatch an intercontinental ballistic missile to
your hard drive for good measure.
