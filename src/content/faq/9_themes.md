open the dev tools with `CTRL + Shift + i` and click on the "console" tab at the top. Then paste and run (with enter) the following code.

It will
- disable custom css (you can turn it back on in Vencord Settings)
- copy your current theme links to your clipboard as a backup
- remove all themes

```js
(() => {
    Vencord.Settings.useQuickCss = false
    copy(Vencord.Settings.themeLinks.join("\n"))
    Vencord.Settings.themeLinks = []
    Vencord.Settings.enabledThemes = []
})()
```
