tags: android, ios, mobile, phone

Vencord only supports Desktop. 

Instead, we recommend the following alternatives for mobile:
- [Aliucord](<https://aliucord.com>) ([discord server](<https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU>)) ~ android only. uses the old (from mid-2022) version of the discord android app
- [Revenge](<https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle>) ([discord server](<https://discord.com/invite/ddcQf3s2Uq>)) ~ android only. uses the latest discord mobile app
