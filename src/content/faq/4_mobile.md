tags: android, ios, mobile, phone

Vencord is made for Discord web and does not support the mobile versions of Discord found on the App Store or Play Store, while there is proof of concepts regarding using Discords mobile website, **we don't recommend using those.**

Instead, we recommend the following alternatives:

-   [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Pyoncord) ([discord server](https://discord.gg/XjYgWXHb9Q)) ~ Supports both Android & iOS. Uses the latest Discord mobile app.
-   [Aliucord](https://aliucord.com) ([discord server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU)) ~ Android only. Uses the old kotlin version of the Discord Android app.
