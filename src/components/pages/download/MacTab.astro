        Download the zip, unzip it and run <Code>VencordInstaller.app</Code>! It

            If you get a VencordInstaller can't be opened warning, right-click
            VencordInstaller.app and click open (macOS Sonoma and earlier)

            If you are using the developer build of macOS Sequoia, or if
            right-clicking isn't working for you, you can allow the app to run
            through your System Settings. <a
