        Download the zip, unzip it and run <Code>VencordInstaller.app</Code>! It
        should list all Discord installs on your System. Pick the one you would
        like to patch and press Install.

        <p>
            If you get a VencordInstaller can't be opened warning, right-click
            VencordInstaller.app and click open (macOS Sonoma and earlier)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are using the developer build of macOS Seqouia, you will need
            to scroll to the bottom of <i>Privacy & Security</i> in your System 
            Settings, and click "Open Anyway" for VencordInstaller.app
        <p>
            This warning is entirely harmless and only shows because the app is
            not signed. Signing it would cost us <a
